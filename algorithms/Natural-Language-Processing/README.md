## Natural Language Processing and Text Mining

Text mining converts text into high quality information which is then used by NLP for analysis.

NLP is part of computer science and artifical intelligence which deals with human languages.

Python provides NLTK library for NLP. Among many things, NLTK also provides CountVectorizer to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.

Use cases of NLP: 
1. Speech Recognition
2. Chatbot
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Machine Translation (Eg. Google translate)
5. Spell check
6. Extracting informaon from a website
7. Avertisement matching

Aspects for NLP:

1. Tokenization: Break complex sentence into words and understand importance of each word with respect to the sentence.
2. Stemming: Normalize words into base form.
eg. eat, eating, eaten have root word 'eat'. some xamples of Stemmers provided by nltk: PorterStemmer, LancasterStemmer etc.
3. Lemmatization: Similar to stemming with a difference that output of Lemmitisation is a proper word. Same may not always be true with stemming.
4. Stop Words: Stop words are provided as part of nltk library, which can be used to ignore them as they are not helpful for language processing.
5. Parts of Speach: NLTK provides POS tags that helps tag various tokens against parts of speach - verb, adjective, noun etc.
6. Named Entity Recognition: locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. 
7. Syntax: Ghostcript can be used as the syntax tree rendering tool.
8. Chunking: Grouping of words/tokens
