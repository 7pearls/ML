## Liniar Regression

It's a type of Supervised Regression ML model.

target is liniarly (directly or inversely) related to the features.

i.e. target = ax + by + c

How much the target is related to a feature (x or y as above) is determined by 
their coefficients (a and b respectively).

A negative coefficient would mean inverse relation with the feature.

Linear regression algorithm works by minimizing the least squares error of the model to the data.
