# SVM - Support Vector Machines

SVM is a supervised learning model that handles multi-dimensional data (with lots of features) quite well. Algorithm like Kmeans works with 2D features. For multiple features, either reduce them using PCA, or use SVM. You can use different 'kernels' (liniar, polynomial, RBF etc.) with SVC.
