1. **Collaborative**: User based: Eg. find similar users and movies liked by 1, are recomended to the other. It has problems: system can have bad users, no. of users are way more than items, users mindset can be fickle.

2. **Content based**: Item based: Overcomes user based issues. If a movie is liked by users who also like another movie, then the person who likes movie 1, is recomended movie 2 as well.
