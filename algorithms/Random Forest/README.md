## random forest (using decision trees)

Type of Supervised Classification.

Multiple decision trees are created as part of training. The output of these decesion trees which is in majority (for the given input) decides which tree will be selected as the final decision.

Q. Why use Random forest? 

Ans. It's meant to work on large set of data, hence produces accurate results. It prevents over-fitting. It helps estimate missing data.

Use cases: Remote sensing, acquiring images of earth surface, Object detection, XBox Kinect.

## Decision Tree important terms
**Entropy** : It's the measure of randomness or unpredictability in the dataset.

**Information Gain**: It's the measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split.

**Leaf Node**: Leaf node carries the classification or the decision.

**Decision Node**: Decision node has 2 or more branches.

**Root Node**: Top most decision node.
