# Data

Machine learning is mainly about understanding the data. One has to spend most of the time to understand and clean the data than applying machine learning algorithms on top of it.

## Types of data

1. **Numerical**: Discrete values. eg stock prices, age, time to do X etc.
2. **Categorical**: eg. Gender, Yes/No (0/1). Numbers used here are only for categorisation, and dont have any mathermatical meaning.
3. **Ordinal**: Data in order. It's basically a categorical data that has mathermatical meaning as well. Eg. Rank of students, 1,2,3,4,5; or movie ratings etc.

**Q.** When is median prefered over mean?
**A.** When we have outliers (eg. a billionare among the salary of middle class population) in the data that skews the mean towards one end.

**Q.** When to use mode?
**A.** For discrete data, and not for continuous data.

-------

**Variance**: Sigma square: Average of squared differences from the mean. It measures how much spread the data has.

**Standard Deviation**: Sigma: Square root of Vairance. It signifies how much of an outlier a data point is from the mean. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual.
