# Data

Machine learning is mainly about understanding the data. One has to spend most of the time to understand and clean the data than applying machine learning algorithms on top of it.

## Types of data

1. **Numerical**: Discrete values. eg stock prices, age, time to do X etc.
2. **Categorical**: eg. Gender, Yes/No (0/1). Numbers used here are only for categorisation, and dont have any mathermatical meaning.
3. **Ordinal**: Data in order. It's basically a categorical data that has mathermatical meaning as well. Eg. Rank of students, 1,2,3,4,5; or movie ratings etc.
